                    <h2>Join the Club</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are two tiers of the membership, social member ($25/month) and fly member ($100/month).
                        For new members, whether social or flying, must pay six (6) months of respective membership dues
                        at the time of sign up.</p>
                    <p>
                        A social member can participate social activities but can not fly airplanes as PIC.
                        This membership invites you and your family to monthly events
                        such as family cookouts, flying, and fun at the airport.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fly members can fly airplanes and participate social activities.
                        Although we limit fly membership to optimize scheduling opportunities for members
                        due to the limited number of airplanes that are currently available,
                        we do have turnover when fly members leave the area or choose to put their flying on hold for a while.</p>
                    <p>
                        Prospective flying members should join as social member first
                        and be put in the wait list for fly membership, and will be converted to fly members when space becomes
                        available.
                    </p>

                    <br/>
                    <h3>After you join</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You're now ready to take flight if you become a fly member!</li>
                        <li>You will be provided with links for scheduling airplanes.</li>
                        <li>Get checked out in club planes:
                            <br/>You'll need to have a checkride with a club Instructor in each plane you intend to fly.
                            Students need their checkride before soloing.
                            Semiannual club checkrides to improve your proficiency are only required in any ONE plane, not all the planes you fly.</li>
                        <li>As a member youâ€™re encouraged (and expected) to participate in meetings,
                            plane cleaning and other volunteer activities.  The more you participate, the greater your overall flying experience.</li>
                    </ul>
